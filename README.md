This is an implementation of the data structures and algorithms described
in the paper [A Conflict-Free Replicated JSON Datatype][paper.abs]
([PDF][paper.pdf]) by **[Martin Kleppmann][kleppmann]** and
**[Alastair R. Beresford][beresford]**.

The goal of this project is to provide a high-level API to the CRDT described
in the paper that integrates well with other JSON libraries for Scala.

## Getting Started

crjdt is currently available for Scala and [Scala.js][scala.js],
version 2.11 and 2.12.

To get started with sbt, add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```sbt
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "eu.timepit" %% "crjdt-core"  % "0.0.6",
  "eu.timepit" %% "crjdt-circe" % "0.0.6" // optional
)
```

Instructions for Maven and other build tools are available on the
[Scaladex][scaladex] page.

## Contributors and participation

crjdt is currently maintained by [Frank S. Thomas][fst9000].

The crjdt project supports the [Typelevel][typelevel]
[code of conduct][typelevel-coc] and wants all of its channels (Gitter,
GitHub, etc.) to be welcoming environments for everyone.

## Other implementations

Currently crjdt is the only public implementation of the JSON CRDT.
We will list other implementations here as soon as they become available.

If you know an implementation that is not listed here, please submit a PR!
